## About ~~us~~ me

Messer Studios is an indie developer production run by me, Jakob. While most of the time I refer to the studio as "us" instead of "I" (no, I have not lost my mind chasing a bug), I someday wish to be joined by more people, and therefore I am just trying to save my future self from refactoring a lot of information later.

I mostly build apps, but occasionally I create some pretty neat scripts to automate my everyday life. I build apps because it is *fun*, and my personal projects serve no commercial purpose. Actually, most of the time the business model is to just break even, and other times there are even losses... But what the hell, in the end, I am glad to have a hobby and passion that is capable of making profits at all.

Thank you for taking the time to read about the studio, and stay tuned for future posts!
